THEME:
1. Download the theme form the repository
2. Extract it to C:\Windows\Resources\Themes
3. Use SecureUX ThemeTool or UltraUX Theme Patcher to apply the theme

BORDERS:
If you want borders, you will need Windhawk, MicaForEveryone, and OpenGlass.
1. Download OpenGlass, install it, and start it up.
2. In Windhawk, create a custom mod using the code found in Borders/Mod.wh.cpp.
3. Compile and activate it. You may need to turn it on and off a few times for it to lock in.
4. In MicaForEveryone, get rid of all sections except for "Global"
5. Set the Background to Mica, Acrylic or Tabbed (NOT Default or none)
6. The borders should work. You may get errors on startup saying OpenGlass cannot work, but it seems fine.
