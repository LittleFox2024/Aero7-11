# Aero7-11
Aero 7 theme for Windows 11 23H2+

## Notes
This is made on the default aero.msstyles in Windows 11. This was made and tested on Windows 11 23H2.
>[!TIP]
>Accent color on the borders is very wierd. If OpenGlass is started before the Windhawk mod, the accent color will show. However, if OpenGlass starts (or restarts) after the Windhawk mod is active, the color will not show on borders.
>If you are not using OpenGlass or DWMBlurGlass, disable the Mica or Acrylic effects in MicaForEveryone, and set your accent color to show on title bars and borders in Settings.


## Credits
This is not truly my own theme, I have basically meshed parts of multiple different themes together. The mod is based off of teknixstuff's "Bring Back the Borders!" mod.
